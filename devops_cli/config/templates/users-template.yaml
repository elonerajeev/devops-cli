# Users Configuration Template
# =====================================
# Bulk register users for the DevOps CLI.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Fill in your users below
#   2. Run: devops admin users-import --file users.yaml
#   3. Securely distribute tokens to each user
#
# IMPORTANT:
#   - Tokens are generated during import and shown ONLY ONCE
#   - Share tokens securely (encrypted email, password manager, etc.)
#   - Users cannot be imported again if they already exist
#
# SECRETS HANDLING:
#   User data is not sensitive, but generated tokens are!
#   Store/distribute tokens using:
#     - AWS Secrets Manager: aws secretsmanager put-secret-value
#     - 1Password, LastPass, or similar
#     - Encrypted email
#
